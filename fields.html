      <h3>Land & Weapon Systems</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to identify the needs for advanced land-based weapon, electronic, and electro-optical systems that enhance precision, survivability, and situational awareness on the battlefield, and to participate in their design and integration to ensure their provision to relevant users at the highest level. We specialize in electro-optical countermeasures systems, infrared optics, laser-based technologies (including designators, pointers, rangefinders, and directed energy applications), and weapon aiming solutions for main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, missile launchers, and remotely controlled weapon systems. Through our innovative reconnaissance, surveillance, and handheld electro-optical solutions, we deliver reliable, high-performance capabilities that support modern land forces in achieving a decisive operational advantage.

      <div class="tag">Air Defense Technologies</div>
      <h3>Air Defense Technologies</h3>
      <p>
        A comprehensive Air and Missile Defense (AMD) mission involves integrating layered defense capabilities to protect critical assets and personnel from all incoming aerial threats, including aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. This requires a sophisticated system utilizing long-range radar detection, command and control coordination, and various interception technologies. Within this layered architecture, specialized air and missile artillery systems, employing high-caliber cannons and short-range rockets, provide the necessary, highly responsive point defense to neutralize threats that penetrate outer defense perimeters. The overall objective is to achieve and maintain continuous battlefield superiority and ensure the integrity of protected airspace through the coordinated detection, tracking, and destruction of these threats at optimal altitudes and ranges.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
        Advanced <strong>avionic systems</strong> and sophisticated <strong>navigation systems</strong> in modern aircraft ensure safe, efficient, and reliable flight operations across all global airspace.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
        These systems use a comprehensive suite of technologies—from satellite-based GPS and ground-based radio navigation aids (like VOR and ILS) to self-contained Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)—to provide pilots and automated flight management systems with precise positioning, situational awareness, and robust guidance. They work together to reduce pilot workload, enhance safety, and enable complex maneuvers and landings in diverse environmental conditions.
